Many nearby lakes have recently benefited from restoration and conservation projects led by organizations such as the Environmentalist Foundation of India (E.F.I.).Note: For specific ecological data or water management status regarding small ponds within the village, residents and researchers are encouraged to consult the Kancheepuram District government resources.",
